# Cellular Coverage Mapping Project

This project demonstrates a practical workflow for mapping and analyzing cellular network coverage based on real-world signal measurements.
It was developed as part of a research project that combines data collection, processing, and visualization to generate high-resolution coverage maps.

## Overview
The repository contains:

Python scripts for reading CSV files with measurement data and generating KML coverage maps.

A LaTeX article describing the methodology, analysis, and results.

Example images and outputs produced by the project.


## Workflow
Collect signal data using the G-MoN Pro application.

Export measurements to a CSV file.

Run the provided Python script to convert the data into a color-coded KML map.

View the generated coverage maps in Google Earth.


## Features
Convert CSV logs of cellular signal measurements into KML maps.

Support for multiple providers, measurement types (voice/data).

Grid-based interpolation to predict coverage in unmeasured areas.

Color-coded map tiles for quick visual insights.

Configurable thresholds for green/yellow/orange/red zones.

Works seamlessly with Google Earth, Google My Maps, and other KML viewers.


## Installation & Quick Start
### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radio-map-generator.git
cd radio-map-generator

### (Optional) create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS

venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Command Line Usage
Basic usage:

python cellmap_kml_generator.py \
  --measurements input.csv \
  --antennas antennas.csv \
  --out coverage_map.kml \
  --metric auto \
  --grid_step_deg 0.0005 \
  --tile_alpha 160


#### Main arguments:

--measurements : CSV file with signal measurements

--antennas : CSV with antenna metadata (optional but recommended)

--out : Output KML file
